Coding test
There are two busineess models I have postulated for the test. The reqiurement.txt is the depedency file which can be installed by using 

pip install -r requiremnt.txt

It depends which of the business model interviewers are comfortable with and ask me to display.

Solarsystemtillclassification model is developed with the conventional machine learning models. In this Business proposal I have defined the whole machine learning pipelining.
The Ipython notebook file is the stub of code in which I have left places to code at different levels, which can be shown during the test.

Other Model is the detection model for brain tumor, which is again related to Health and Wellness Industry.
This model is developed in Convolution and Tansfer Learning methods. Hence we need more powerful tool to develop the model. I have created this project in a real time scenarion 
and implementation.
The Ipython Notebook again consists of code stubs which is empty and filled at the time of interview.
